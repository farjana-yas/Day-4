 <p>The <strong> <i> Cat</i></strong>  (Felis catus), also referred to as domestic <b><i>cat</i></b> or house <b>cat</b>, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around <b>7500</b> BC. It is commonly kept as a pet and farm <b>cat</b>, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact.</p>
